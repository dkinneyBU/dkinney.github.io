I grew up on Long Island in the 60s and 70s and entered the U.S. Navy after graduating from High School.
I earned an Associate's degree in General Science from the State University of New York while serving.
I've traveled around quite a bit, working for a number of different companies in different roles--
Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland Michigan and now Georgia, in positions such
as Director of Information Systems, Technical Support Manager, Full Stack Developer and Data Scientist.

As I moved around, I attended Universities wherever I happened to be living--Lock Haven State University
in Pennsylvania, the New York Institute of Technology, and was finally conferred a B.S. (Cum Laude)
with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Math from the University of Hartford in Connecticut, in 1990.

And just this Spring, I completed a Master's in Data Science from Bellevue University in Nebraska.

I currently live in Dacula, GA and work for Truist Financial as a Business Intelligence Lead Consultant.
My back yard is my sanctuary, where I like to sit and read or play guitar. I've also recently returned
to hiking, something I loved to do in my 20s and 30s.
