Conversely, is it possible to identify variables that do not reflect a direct cause?</h2>
<p>The FARS data is huge, encompassing a number of individual tables (the FARS guide is available from my GitHub repo). I focused on just two: accidents and person. I have little doubt there is a plethora of useful data in the remaining tables that might lead to entirely different conclusions when not locked in to just two of the datasets.</p>
