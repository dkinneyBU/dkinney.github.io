My wife Annette and I went away for five days without "the kids". By day, she went to a knitting retreat, and I hiked, read, played guitar and napped. We stayed at the **Deer Lick Falls Retreat** in Monteagle, Tennessee. It had three hiking trails of varying skill level, the hike down to the falls being the hardest. It was a challenge climbing back out--got my heart rate up to 150 bpm! But it was a beautiful hike and I'm glad I did it.
