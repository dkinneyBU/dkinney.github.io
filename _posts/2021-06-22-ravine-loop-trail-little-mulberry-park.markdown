Little Mulberry Park is only about an 8-minute drive from The Sanctuary (my home) in Dacula. I drove over for my lunch break and hiked the Ravine Loop trail. It's about 2.5 miles, and is challenging due to the uphill hike on the back side. Most of it is well paved and there are signs everywhere. In general the whole trail is well maintained. This place will definitely be my go-to hiking destination.
